# Simple Mobile Theme
Published mainly for my own use as this seemed like the simplest way to add a custom theme to an iOS device. All are welcome to try.

This is a very simple variant of the default obsidian theme:
- Changes to bold and italics increase visibility
- Changes to headings help discriminate level
- Black background enhances OLED screen experience
