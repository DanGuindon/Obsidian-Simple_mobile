# Simple mobile theme
Published for my own personal use as this was the easiest way to add the theme on my ipad mini. All are welcome to try.

This is a very simple variant of the default obsidian theme:
- Changes to bold and italics increase visibility
- Changes to headings help discriminate level
- Black background enhances OLED screen experience
